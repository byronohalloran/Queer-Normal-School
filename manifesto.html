        </div>
        <div class="aboutHeroType">
            <h4>HISS explores the notion of a queer-led classroom dedicated to embodied
                learning and knowledge building. Loosely based around familiar school subjects, spaces and experiences, HISS unfolds as a series of experimental workshops led by internationally recognized queer scholars and practitioners.<br><span>The Institute builds on the observation that all of us, young or old, established or emerging, have been students at some time and might usefully revisit that experience in a queer context. Activities include fieldtrips, school photographs and a formal – all teenage rites of passage that can strike fear in the hearts of queer kids.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="aboutHeroType">
            <h4>The inaugural Institute was timed to coincide with Sydney Mardi Gras and the Sydney WorldPride Festival, which saw thousands of LGBTQI+ folk of all ages descend on Sydney. Focused on the theme of ‘Queer Age / Queer Youth’, the Institute invited emerging researchers to think in two temporalities at once: retrospectively, with a deep understanding of past wrongs, and proleptically, in anticipation of a more just future. In 2023, the Institute welcomed 23 advanced PhD students and post-doctoral researchers, representing 16 different universities.
                <br><span>The Hunt-Simes Institute in Sexuality Studies is not like other specialist intensives, many of which are theory-intensive. HISS is modelled on the generalist classroom rather than the expert seminar. It emphasises the beginner’s mind and collective embodied learning. Across HISS 2023, the HISS faculty and students learned a lot about cohort building. In HISS 2024, we want to continue to reflect on that process under the theme of Queer Relationality.</span>

            <h3>2024:Queer Relationality</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="aboutHeroType">
            <h4>Many of us work on relationality in one form or another. <a href="faculty.html">The 2024 HISS Faculty,</a> for instance, have significant expertise in thinking about queer relationality regarding sex, to others, to kinship, to history, to media, to genre, to games, to artificial intelligence, to methods, to space, to institutions, and to diversity. Many of our foundational experiences of these and other forms of relationality can be traced to school settings.
                <br><span>The global rise of the marriage equality movement has recentred discussion of queer relationality in what many consider irrevocably heteronormative terms. By situating relationality in the context of schooling, learning and pedagogy, we hope to bring out new understandings of queer attachment, friendship, community, affect and thriving, which seems particularly important given the current clampdown on LGBTQI+ inclusive education in many jurisdictions.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="aboutHeroType">
            <h4>HISS is funded through the generous bequests of Dr Gary Simes and Norman Haire. Dr Gary Simes (BA ’73, PhD ’79) was a linguistic historian, bibliographer and University of
                Sydney graduate—the Hunt-Simes Chair of Sexuality Studies bequest enables a number of visiting fellowships per year. Norman Haire, an sex education reformer, left a bequest to the University of Sydney to provide financial assistance to Honours, Masters by Research, PhD students and academics who are undertaking research in Sexology.
                We have defined Sexology as the interdisciplinary study of human sexualities, including human sexual interests, behaviours, identities, expectations and experiences. Sexology encompasses research into human sexualities using tools from a range of fields including biology, criminology, empirical cultural, feminist and queer studies, medicine, psychology and sociology.
